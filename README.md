# Utter Nonsense!

This webpage displays a stanza of Edward Lear's **Nonsense Alphabet 1**. The chosen stanza begins with "D was a duck" and is about a duck. There is an image of a duck to accompany the poem.

This page includes:
- A light/dark mode toggle button that first follows system preferences and will remember the user's choice using local storage
  - Sass maps, CSS Custom Properties, and Javascript :)
- Adam Argyle's [Open Props](https://open-props.style)
  - colors, sizes, transitions, animations, gradients, fluid typography
- variable fonts
- responsive layout


In development I used:
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

Other resources:
- Adam Argyle's open props, and his Youtube video called [Thinking on ways to solve a DARK/LIGHT THEME SWITCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZiS1QStIWc)
  - I used the same svg he uses, including a lot of the css and javascript for the toggle button
